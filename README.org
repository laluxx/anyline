* Anyline

Anyline is a collection of modules for Unix bars that automatically refresh their colors based on changes to the Pywal cache. This enables the modules to adapt seamlessly to any Pywal theme.

** Structure

The project is organized into separate modules that can be added to any bar. Currently, there are three modules available:

- Cores
- Web
- Xmv

Each module resides in its own directory and has its own Python environment.

#+BEGIN_SRC
.
├── cores
│   ├── env
│   └── main.py
├── web
│   ├── env
│   └── main.py
└── xmv
    ├── env
    └── main.py
#+END_SRC

** Usage

1. Clone this repository: =git clone https://github.com/yourusername/anyline.git=
2. Navigate into the directory of the module you want to use.
3. Activate the Python environment: =source env/bin/activate=
4. Run the =main.py= script to start the module.

** Notes

The modules automatically update their colors based on changes in the Pywal cache. Therefore, each time you change your Pywal theme, the modules will update accordingly.

Enjoy a dynamic and colorful Unix bar with Anyline!
